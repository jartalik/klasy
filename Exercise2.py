# Previously, you wrote a class called ExerciseSession that
# had three attributes: an exercise name, an intensity, and a
# duration.
#
# Add a new method to that class called calories_burned.
# calories_burned should have no parameters (besides self, as
# every method in a class has). It should return an integer
# representing the number of calories burned according to the
# following formula:
#
# - If the intensity is "Low", 4 calories are burned per
#   minute.
# - If the intensity is "Medium", 8 calories are burned
#   per minute.
# - If the intensity is "High", 12 calories are burned per
#   minute.
#
# You may copy your class from the previous exercise and just
# add to it.


# Add your code here!
